Since the Early Day's of the Macintosh, and more significantly the inception of NeXTSTEP, I've been a tech proponent
of OO and various languanges supporting it.  Having dabbled in Objective C on NeXTSTEP back in the day, I was pleasantly
surprised to see it again in Xcode for iOS.    When employed at MCI WorldCom (LDDS Metromedia in the advanced technology devision), 
we had the luxury of experimenting with many early PDA type devices including Apple Newton, Sony devices, etc.  

Fast forward multiple years and experience under my belt with Web, PHP, .ASP, ASP.NET,.NET, along comes the iPhone.
It was a truly exciting time back in 2011 diving back into Objective C and Xcode.  

And in 2014, Chris Lattner @ Apple introduced **[Swift](https://swift.org)** at WWDC.  It was a great experience attending that year!

And now, **attribution** where it's due:

Steve Jobs for pushing hard and keeping his dreams alive
Steve Wosniac for the Macintosh
Tim Berners-Lee - For the World wide web
Bill Gates & MS Teams- Everything Windows, PC and .NET, C#
Rasmus Lerdorf - Designer of PHP
Chris Lattner - Swift Language

***Without history where would we be?***
