## Thoughts on Mobile Architecture and Development 

![](https://cjazz.github.io/assets/images/clipartwiki.com-architect-clipart-1437482.png)

As an iOS Developer, Engineer, Architecht, I've learned a few things
I'd like to share that I think you'll benefit from.

First let's draw a distinction....

**What's the difference between Development and Architecture?**

A number of years ago, I was the manager of a few "Production Development" teams.  
These teams would receive input from Arctitects, who basically wrote functional prototypes and sometimes tech specs.  The Production Dev teams would utilize those artifacts and would develop the final solution.
The big difference here was the prod developers would prepare prodution ready code.  Meaning that the code could withstand the rigors of being called many orders of magnitue without degredation (into the millions).  

*This illustrates a classical example between software Architechts and Developers*


As an iOS Developer, I firmly believe you'll need to encompass skills from *Architecht* and *Developer* in order to stay relevant/viable.

From an Architect stand point, you'll need to validate the viability of the "New", by spinning up those Git repo examples, subplant them in a feature branch of your current work, push the boundaries where you see fit (for your needs)..

You'll then have the opportunitiy to suggest these new solutions where applicable.  Big plus to your team/company, etc..  You do want to be a Rock Star right?

This is important even though you might be doing the same kind of coding tasks day in and out.  

Why?  What happens of the company you work for which was Angel funded runs out of money?


*Developer*

From a pure development stand point, it's in your best interest to stay on top of all the relevant new Apple framework additions, advances in techniques, idioms, etc.  This is outside the realm of your day to day coding at your job.   Call it *personal tech insurance* if you'd like.

How you may ask?

1. Objectively Check out new Tech stacks, Frameworks and Git Repos of others
2. WWDC - Each year, Watch all the videos - Or better yet go if you can, but if you go, watch all the videos because if  you go you'll un-doubtly mis sessions.
3. Learn all the time
4. Objectively listen to others
5. Objectively listen to yourself
6. Be critical of your skills and Learn, Learn Learn
