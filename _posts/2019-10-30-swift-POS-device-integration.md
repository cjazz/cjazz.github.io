<span style="font-size:12pt">When newer iOS Developers ask me how to add hardware integration for a Mobile - Point of Sale solution, I usually show them live examples.

Most vendors provide hardware specific custom Frameworks or Static libs to install in xcode projects.

Since Objective C has been around much longer than Swift, the hardware vendors will tipically provide working demo apps written in Objective C.  If you're writing a new Swift app, you'll end up having to write a Swift version.

From a best practices standpoint I recommend making a quick app such as this one posted on my [GitHub](https://github.com/cjazz/DTDevDemo) repo to quickly test the device out.

As you get to know the hardware vendors Framwork/.lib, you can add more bells and whistles.
