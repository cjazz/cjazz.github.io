<span style="font-size:12pt">URLSession is like the bread and butter of many iOS Apps today.  Use of it has evolved over time in context of consuming JSON.  From leveraging JSONSerialization().jsonObject, to JSONDecoder() / JSONEncoder(), it's all part of the history in the iOS world.</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt">Apple introduced Combine, a new Framework at [WWDC2019](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/722/).</span>   

<span style="font-size:12pt">It can be used in a number of ways including making async network calls, and a few more rich use cases.</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt">I've put together an app
that demonstrates using Combine to make web calls (JSON consumption).</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt">I go into detail this time, but I have to say Combine very promising!</span>


<span style="font-size:12pt">If you notice, this represents a bit of a code reduction, which I enjoy (and my keyboard will last longer because of said code reductions).</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt">Here's the xcode [project](https://github.com/cjazz/Swift-URLSession-Combine)


<span style="font-size:12pt">**Happy Coding!**</span>

<span style="font-size:12pt">More to come (my promise)</span>
