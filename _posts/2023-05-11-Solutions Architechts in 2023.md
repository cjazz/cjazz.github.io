It’s been a while since I’ve posted my thoughts.  
I usually have the best clarity thinking in retrospect base on my life experiences, so Let’s jump right in!

Solutions Architecture has evolved some over the years, and more an more companies want their  Developers to think and act like a Solutions Architects. The rise in popularity of DevOps, CICD, and the Full Stack developer has in part driven this sentiment.

Currently, I believe a Solutions Architect is someone who takes a goal and determines one or many viable paths for achieving that goal.

**It’s also **very** important to be able to produce a working prototype quickly, without extra bells and whistles.  Stand alone or in your existing app.**

It all starts with a Mission statement from a **Product Owner**, or decision maker:

**Mission Statement**
"Create a Chat interface that leveraged AI or ML
to produce suggested Emoji’s based on what was being typed in the chat message, and allow that person to tap and insert the Emoji in the text message"

Here's the working prototype:  https://github.com/cjazz/NatLangSentimentAnalysis

With an **MVP** mind set (Minimal Viable Product), I produced a working prototype that demonstrated it.  No diagrams, no documentation, just a simple App to demo.  

**Now** fast forward the conversation, the **Product Owner** says, I really like that, let’s do it!

Now the work really begins….

> ####  At this point further analysis/coding/research would need to happen depending on your needs:
>
> - How will this fit into the existing app (optional)
>
> - Does this functionality require back end services?  Do those perform well under load?	
>
> - Will this Perform well in Production, under load (sub second responses)?
>
> - Does this need a layer of security?
>
> - Does this conform with ADA (hearing/vision)?


Ultimately a Solutions Architect is a hands on developer (unless your organization is steeped in $$ and roles)

In the spirit larger organizations, this article is worth a read: https://www.cloudelicious.net/what-type-of-architect-are-you/, by a Microsoft CTO Architect (Michel Luescher)

If operating in smaller organizations **Solutions Architechts** are developers.  Developers should think and behave like a Solutions Architects, or Mobile Solutions Architect given I specialize in Mobile...

Either way, a title is just that, a title...As a Developer on any level, you would bring more value to an organization/company if thinking and acting out of the box, period.

Note about the sample app:

With Apple’s Natural Language API, I’m was able to provide the necessary  functionality with very little code. I literally wrote this in a few hours.

Swift language, SwiftUI, and Apple hardware / software advancments have been a joy to work with...

**Happy Coding!**
